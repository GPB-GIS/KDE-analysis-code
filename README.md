# KDE-analysis-code


Code and mock data for the creating of KDE maps supporting publication of "Detecting geographic communities using CDRs". To understand the workflow, read through the GIS workflow document in the Code folder. 

- Mock CDR data is provided, but it is in no way realistic or representative of the data used. 

- Mock cell tower locations are used; they are in the same geographical area as the towers used by the paper, but do not reflect real world towers. 

- The 11 district administrative shapefile is also provided to enable the generation of Voronoi tesselations from the mock towers within this area. 

- The "ssc_csv" is a mock version of the output provided to the author from CDR processing.
